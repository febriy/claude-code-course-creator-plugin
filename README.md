<!-- EDIT: Too technical, simplify -->
<!-- FIX: Add real-world example -->

/course-creation:edit my-ai-course courses/my-ai-course/content/module1.md

# Second round: Different file, but plugin remembers your preferences
/course-creation:edit my-ai-course courses/my-ai-course/content/module2.md
# Plugin now knows you prefer simpler language and real-world examples!
```

---

## üìä Learning System

The `/edit` command builds a learning history:

**How it works:**
1. Every time you run `/edit`, your comments are logged
2. Comments are stored in `courses/{COURSE}/.edit-history/comments-log.jsonl`
3. Future edits analyze this history to understand your preferences
4. The style guide evolves based on your actual feedback patterns

**What gets learned:**
- Your tone preferences
- Common issues you flag
- Your structural preferences
- Spelling and citation standards you prefer

**Benefits:**
- Edits become more aligned with your style over time
- Less repetitive feedback needed
- Proactive identification of issues you care about
- Data-driven style guide improvements

      1_2_section.md
      2_1_section.md
      ...
    docs/                       # Course documentation

        ...
    .edit-history/              # Learning history (auto-generated)
      comments-log.jsonl        # All your past feedback
      backups/                  # Timestamped backups
```

---

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Follow the Numbered Workflow
For new courses, use commands 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4 in order for best results.

### 2. Use Comments for Precise Control
Add inline comments to guide edits exactly where you want them:
```markdown
<!-- EDIT: Add citation here -->
<!-- FIX: Simplify this paragraph -->
```

### 3. Review Before Editing
Always run `/review` before `/edit --from-review` to see what will be changed.

### 4. Iterate in Small Steps
Make small, incremental edits. Review after each change.

### 5. Let the Plugin Learn
The more you use `/edit` with comments, the smarter it gets about your preferences.

### 6. Use Extract for Legacy Content
Have old course materials? Use `/extract-course-info` to bring them into the plugin's structure.

### 7. Restructure Carefully
Before running `/restructure`, make sure you have backups. It changes file names and references.
