# Atomic Essay Writer Skill

## Purpose

Write structured, compelling LinkedIn posts (~300 words) using Nicolas Cole's atomic essay methodology.

**Goal:** Write a complete post in 10-15 minutes by following a proven 4-part structure.

---

## The 4 Puzzle Pieces

Every atomic essay has exactly **4 components**:

1. **Headline** - The promise
2. **Intro** - Hook them in
3. **Main Points** - Deliver the value
4. **Conclusion** - Add new insight

---

## Piece 1: The Headline

**Purpose:** Make a clear, specific promise

### The Formula
```
[Problem/Goal] + [Number] + [Specific Promise]
```

### Examples
- "3 things you need to do to successfully quit your job"
- "5 mistakes I made learning AI (so you don't have to)"
- "The 4-step framework I use to make decisions in 10 minutes"

### Refinement Process

**Spend 2-3 minutes iterating.** Don't settle for your first attempt.

**Ask:**
1. What's the problem/goal?
2. What's the promise?
3. Is it specific enough?

**Example Iteration:**

❌ Draft 1: "Three mistakes I made saving money trying to quit my job so I could become a freelance writer"
- Too long, convoluted

⚠️ Draft 2: "If you want to quit your job, don't make these three money management mistakes"
- Better, but still vague

✅ Final: "3 things you need to do to successfully quit your job"
- Clean, clear, specific

**Rule:** Iterate the headline 3-4 times before writing anything else.

---

## Piece 2: The Intro

**Purpose:** Tell readers they're in the right place + make them want to continue

**Length:** 5-8 lines (what shows before "see more" on LinkedIn)

### The 5-Element Checklist

Use this checklist **every single time**:

1. ✅ **What is this about?** - Set the context
2. ✅ **Who is this for?** - Help reader self-identify
3. ✅ **What's the promise?** - What will they gain?
4. ✅ **Why trust you?** - Your credibility
5. ✅ **Benefit to reader** - Make it explicit

### Example with Labels

> **Do you have a side hustle that you wish was your full-time career?** ← *What is this about?*
>
> Back in 2016, I was working as an entry-level copywriter for an ad agency. I had to commute two hours per day, spending the other eight hours writing ads for everyone from local pizza joints to national coconut water brands.
>
> It was decent work, but not my life's work. ← *Who is this for?*
>
> My dream was to write books, not ads.
>
> In order to successfully quit my job and go all in on writing, I needed to get a few things straight: ← *Mirror the headline*
> - I needed to get my income straight
> - I needed to get my work ethic straight
> - I needed to get my portfolio straight
>
> After all, how was I going to pay the bills?
>
> **If this sounds like you, or you've been debating how to successfully quit your job and go all in on your side hustle, let me save you some time** ← *Promise + Benefit* **and give you the recipe that ultimately allowed me to achieve my goal.** ← *Credibility*

### Pro Tip: Mirror the Headline

Notice "successfully quit your job" appears in both headline and intro. This creates cohesion.

---

## Piece 3: The Main Points (Body)

### Step 1: Prep the Page FIRST

**Before writing, outline your structure:**

```
[Intro]

Point #1: [Headline]

Point #2: [Headline]

Point #3: [Headline]

[Conclusion]
```

**Why this works:**
- See the whole piece at a glance
- Stay organized
- Just "fill in the blanks"

**Your point headlines should mirror your main headline.**

Example:
- Headline: "3 things you need to do to successfully quit your job"
- Point 1: "I needed to get my income straight"
- Point 2: "I needed to get my work ethic and daily routine straight"
- Point 3: "I needed to get my portfolio straight"

---

### Step 2: Use the "1-3-1" Pattern

This is **Nicolas Cole's secret weapon** for writing each point.

**The Pattern:**
- **1 sentence** - Topic sentence
- **3-5 sentences** - Explanation, story, details, examples
- **1 sentence** - Transition or summary

### Example (Point #1)

> **[1 sentence]** First things first, I needed to start saving money.
>
> **[3 sentences]** I projected I would need approximately $5,000 to quit my job so I could continue paying my overhead expenses for roughly three months. My overhead looked like this: $1,500/month for rent, $200/month for food, and $100/month for my train pass. So roughly, $1,800/month to live.
>
> **[1 sentence]** Once I had this number in my mind, I relentlessly saved money to hit it.

**Why it works:**
- Creates rhythm (short → detailed → short)
- Easy to scan
- Forces conciseness
- Repeatable pattern

**Repeat this 1-3-1 pattern for each of your main points (typically 3-5 points).**

---

### Variations: 1-4-1 or 1-5-1

You can adjust the middle section:
- **1-3-1** for simpler points
- **1-4-1** for moderate detail
- **1-5-1** for richer stories

The pattern stays the same: **short → detailed → short**

---

## Piece 4: The Conclusion

**Purpose:** Don't recap—add something NEW

**Length:** 3-5 lines

### What NOT to Do

❌ Repeat what you already said
❌ "So to recap, I talked about X, Y, and Z..."

### What TO Do

✅ Introduce a **new insight** or **bigger lesson**
✅ Give fresh perspective
✅ Leave something memorable

### Example

> By doing these three things, I immediately started getting clients the moment I quit my job.
>
> And what I learned was that **in order to successfully quit your job and go all in on your side hustle, the decision has to come long before you leave the office.**
>
> If you prepare correctly, it doesn't feel like a leap at all. **Instead, it should feel like the next logical step.**

**Notice:** He didn't just recap the 3 things. He added a NEW idea: *"The decision happens long before you quit."*

**That's the memorable takeaway.**

## Time Breakdown (10-13 Minutes Total)

Nicolas Cole's actual timing:

- **2-3 minutes:** Refine headline (iterate 3-4 times)
- **1 minute:** Prep the page (outline 3 main points)
- **4-5 minutes:** Write intro (5-element checklist)
- **3-4 minutes:** Write body (1-3-1 for each point)
- **1-2 minutes:** Write conclusion (add new insight)

**Why it's fast:** You're following a structure, not inventing one.

---

## How to Use This in `/create-post`

### Step 1: Create the Headline Together

Ask:
> "Let's start with your headline. Based on your angle, here are 3 options:
>
> 1. [Headline option 1]
> 2. [Headline option 2]
> 3. [Headline option 3]
>
> Which direction feels right?"

Iterate 2-3 times until it's clean.

---

### Step 2: Show the Outline

> "Here's the structure:
>
> **Intro:** [Brief summary]
>
> **Point 1:** [Headline language]
> **Point 2:** [Headline language]
> **Point 3:** [Headline language]
>
> **Conclusion:** [New insight you'll add]
>
> Does this work?"

---

### Step 3: Write Section by Section

**For the Intro:**
- Use the 5-element checklist
- Show them the draft
- Confirm before moving on

**For Each Main Point:**
- Use 1-3-1 structure
- Keep it concise
- Mirror headline language

**For the Conclusion:**
- Don't recap

---

### Step 4: Review Together

---

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Settling for first headline**
→ ✅ Iterate 3-4 times

**❌ Writing without outline**
→ ✅ Prep the page first

**❌ Skipping intro checklist elements**
→ ✅ Hit all 5 every time

**❌ Rambling in body**
→ ✅ Strict 1-3-1 structure

**❌ Recapping in conclusion**
→ ✅ Add new insight

**❌ Trying to be "original" with structure**
→ ✅ Repeat proven patterns

---

## The Key Mindset

**From Nicolas Cole:**

> "I was thinking a lot less about the actual writing and a lot more about the THINKING. What do I want to say? And then the organization just takes care of itself."

**Translation:**
- Spend time on your **idea** (the thinking)
- Don't overthink **structure** (it's always the same)

**The 4 pieces never change:**
1. Headline
2. Intro (5 elements)
3. Main points (1-3-1 × 3)
4. Conclusion (new insight)

**What changes:** Your topic, stories, examples, insights.

---

## Why This Works

**Readers don't notice structure. They notice VALUE.**

You can use this exact template 100 times, 1,000 times. They won't care.

They'll care that:
- The headline grabbed them
- The intro resonated
- The main points helped them
- The conclusion made them think

**That's what matters.**

## Success Criteria

This skill succeeds when:
- ✅ Post follows 4-piece structure
- ✅ User writes draft in 10-15 minutes
- ✅ Each section serves its purpose
- ✅ Post feels polished and professional
- ✅ User gains confidence through repetition
- ✅ Structure becomes automatic (thinking > structure)
