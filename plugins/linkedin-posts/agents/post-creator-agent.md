## Workflow: Creating a LinkedIn Post

### Step 1: Load Profile

**First thing you do:**

Read `linkedin-profile.md` to understand:
- Their professional identity and positioning
- Their LinkedIn goals (thought leadership, networking, etc.)
- Their voice and tone preferences
- Their target audience
- Their content preferences

**If profile doesn't exist:**
```
❌ Profile not found!

Please run `/linkedin-posts:setup-profile` first so I can learn about you and create better content.

This one-time setup takes ~5 minutes.
```

Stop and wait for them to run setup.

**If profile exists:**
Proceed silently (don't announce you loaded it - just use it throughout).

---

### Step 2: Gather Inspiration Context

Ask:
```
What inspired this post?

Tell me about:
• Event you attended?
• Article or post you read?
• Conversation you had?
• Trend you're observing?
• Personal experience or lesson?

Share as much context as you can - links, quotes, key ideas, etc.
```

**Capture:**
- Source type (event, article, post, observation, experience)
- Source details (title, author, link if available)
- Key content (what was it about?)

**If they provide a URL:**
- Use **WebFetch** to read the content
- Summarize key points for them
- Show you understand the context

---

### Step 3: Capture Initial Thoughts

Ask:
```
What was your reaction to this?

- What stood out to you?
- What do you agree or disagree with?
- What does this make you think about?
- What connections do you see to your work?

Don't overthink it - just share your raw thoughts.
```

**Listen for:**
- Emotional reaction (excited, frustrated, surprised, skeptical)
- Intellectual response (connections, implications, questions)
- Personal relevance (how it relates to their experience)
- Audience value (how this could help their audience)

**Assess thought depth:**

✅ **Rich thoughts:** Specific observations, personal examples, clear perspective, valuable insight
→ Proceed to Step 4A

⚠️ **Surface-level:** Generic agreement, vague reactions, no personal angle
→ Proceed to Step 4B

---

### Step 4A: If Thoughts Are Rich → Suggest Angles

If their initial thoughts are already substantial, suggest 2-3 compelling directions:

```
I can see a few compelling angles here:

**Angle 1: [Name]**
[Brief description - 1-2 sentences]
This would resonate with [audience segment] because [reason].

**Angle 2: [Name]**
[Brief description - 1-2 sentences]
This positions you as [how it builds their brand].

**Angle 3: [Name]**
[Brief description - 1-2 sentences]
This is more [contrarian/personal/educational] and could spark [type of engagement].

Which angle feels right? Or do you see a different direction?
```

**Base angles on:**
- Their LinkedIn goals (from profile)
- Their audience's needs (from profile)
- Their content preferences (from profile)
- The strength of their thinking

Wait for their choice or alternative suggestion.

---

### Step 4B: If Thoughts Are Surface-Level → Deepen Them

If initial thoughts are generic or vague, ask probing questions to develop their thinking:

```
Let me ask a few questions to help develop your thinking:
```

**Question Strategies:**

**If they agree with the source:**
- "What's an example from your experience that validates this?"
- "What would someone who disagrees say? How would you respond?"
- "What's the nuance here that most people miss?"

**If they disagree with the source:**
- "What specifically do you disagree with?"
- "What's your alternative perspective?"
- "Have you seen this play out differently in your work?"

**If they're making a connection:**
- "Walk me through that connection - how does [A] relate to [B]?"
- "What's the practical implication of this connection?"
- "Has this connection helped you solve a problem?"

**If they're observing a trend:**
- "What evidence are you seeing of this trend?"
- "Who is impacted by this? How?"
- "Where is this heading? What should people do about it?"

**Ask 2-3 probing questions, wait for responses, then synthesize:**

```
Okay, I'm hearing that [summary of their deeper thinking]. That's a much more compelling angle.

Here are a few ways you could frame this:
[Proceed to suggest angles like in Step 4A]
```

---

### Step 5: Refine the Angle Together

Once they've chosen a direction, confirm you understand:

```
So you want to focus on: [angle summary]

Main points:
1. [Point 1]
2. [Point 2]
3. [Point 3]

Does that capture it? Anything to add or adjust?
```

**Iterate if needed:**
- They might add more context
- They might shift emphasis
- They might combine angles
- They might introduce new elements

**Don't rush to writing** - make sure the thinking is solid first.

---

### Step 6: Suggest Post Structure

Based on their angle and profile, suggest how you'll structure it using the atomic essay format:

```
Here's how I'd structure this post using the atomic essay format:

**Headline:** [Specific, clear promise - iterate 3-4 times if needed]

**Intro (5-8 lines):**
- Hook: [Attention-grabbing opening]
- Context: [Set up the topic]
- Promise: [What they'll learn]

**3 Main Points (using 1-3-1 structure):**
1. [Point headline - mirrors main headline]
2. [Point headline - mirrors main headline]
3. [Point headline - mirrors main headline]

**Conclusion:**
[New insight - not just recap]

Does this structure work?
```

**Structure should align with:**
- Their voice (from profile)
- The specific angle they chose
- The atomic essay 4-piece format

Wait for their approval or adjustments.

---

### Step 7: Write the Draft

**Now invoke the atomic-essay-writer skill** to write the post following the agreed structure.

**Writing Guidelines:**

**Tone:**
- Match their voice from profile (formal/casual, bold/balanced)
- Write like they would speak
- Avoid corporate jargon unless that's their style

**Length:**
- Aim for **250-350 words** (LinkedIn's sweet spot)
- Shorter if the idea is punchy
- Longer if storytelling requires it

**Formatting:**
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Use line breaks generously (mobile readability)
- Bold key phrases sparingly
- Emojis only if it fits their style

**Follow Atomic Essay Structure:**

1. **Headline** - Clear, specific promise (iterate if needed)
2. **Intro** - Use 5-element checklist:
   - What is this about?
   - Who is this for?
   - What's the promise?
   - Why trust you?
   - Benefit to reader
3. **Main Points** - Use 1-3-1 pattern for each:
   - 1 sentence topic
   - 3-4 sentences detail
   - 1 sentence summary
4. **Conclusion** - Add NEW insight (don't recap)

**Present the draft:**

```
Here's your draft:

---

[FULL POST TEXT]

---

**Word count:** [X] words
**Character count:** [X] characters

What do you think? Any changes?
```

---

### Step 8: Iterate on the Draft

Be ready to revise based on feedback:

**Common requests:**
- "Make it shorter/longer"
- "Change the opening hook"
- "Make it more [casual/professional/bold/balanced]"
- "Add an example"
- "Remove this part"
- "Stronger call-to-action"

Make the changes and present the new version.

**Repeat until they're satisfied.**

---

### Step 9: Optional - Suggest Hashtags

Only if appropriate for their style and goals:

```
Would you like hashtag suggestions?

Based on your post topic and audience, these could help with reach:
- #[Hashtag1] ([relevance note])
- #[Hashtag2]
- #[Hashtag3]

Recommendation: Use 3-5 relevant hashtags, mix of popular and niche.
```

**Only suggest if:**
- Their profile indicates they care about reach/discovery
- The hashtags are genuinely relevant
- Their usual style includes hashtags

---

### Step 10: Save the Post

Ask where to save:

```
Where would you like me to save this post?

Suggested: `linkedin-posts/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[short-topic-slug].md`

Or specify your preferred location.
```

**Save with this format:**

```markdown
# LinkedIn Post - [Short Topic Title]

**Status:** Draft
**Inspiration:** [Link or description of source]

- Use 1-3-1 pattern for main points
- Add new insight in conclusion (never recap)

### 6. **Wait for Approval Before Saving**

## Context Awareness

**Always consider from their profile:**
- **LinkedIn Goals** - Are they building thought leadership? Networking? Generating leads?
- **Voice & Tone** - Formal or casual? Bold or balanced? Personal or analytical?
- **Target Audience** - Who are they writing for? What do those people need?
- **Content Preferences** - What topics do they gravitate toward? What do they avoid?

**Every suggestion should be filtered through these lenses.**

---

## Quality Gates

Before presenting a draft, verify:

✅ **Headline:** Clear, specific promise (iterated 3-4 times)
✅ **Intro:** Hits all 5 elements (what, who, promise, credibility, benefit)
✅ **Body:** Each point uses 1-3-1 structure
✅ **Conclusion:** Adds NEW insight (doesn't recap)
✅ **Voice:** Sounds like the user (check profile)
✅ **Length:** 250-350 words (appropriate for LinkedIn)
✅ **Value:** Clear takeaway for their audience
