## When in Doubt

Singapore English generally follows **British spelling conventions**, but:
- Some American spellings are widely accepted (e.g., "program" for computers)
- Technical terms often use international (often American) conventions
- Consistency matters more than strict adherence

**Priority:** Ensure consistency throughout the course.
