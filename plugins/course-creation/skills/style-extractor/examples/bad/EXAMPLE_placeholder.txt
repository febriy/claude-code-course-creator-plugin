This is a placeholder file for NEGATIVE examples.

This folder is OPTIONAL but helpful.

Add example text files here that show styles you want to AVOID:
- Too casual
- Too formal/academic
- Too much jargon
- Condescending tone
- Overly enthusiastic/marketing-speak
- Whatever you don't want in your content

The skill will analyze these to create "Don't Do This" sections in your style guide.
